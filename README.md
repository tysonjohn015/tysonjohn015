# 👋 About me

- 🌱 I am pursuing an OpenClassrooms training program as Artificial Intelligence Engineer (May 2021 - July 2022), developed in partnership with Microsoft and Centrale Supelec. Details can be found [here](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/188-ingenieur-ia).

- 🛫 I keep on learning Data Science, Machine and Deep learning, Cloud computing, and deployment of algorithms into production. 

- 💞️ I'm really interested in problem solving and decision taking with data. My focus is to develop, optimize and reformulate repeatable models to solve challenging and high-value business problems and provide actionable insights.

- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on real world or research experience in machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence, to grow as data scientist, ideally, in creation of new capabilities for company's profitability and efficiency, in collaboration with product managers and engineers.

- 📫 How to reach me : **I can add you as a collaborator if needed** and share my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tysonjohn/) details too. Keep in touch!
